# AI/NLP Internship - Evaluation Task

This project is a personalized productivity coach designed to assess a user's work habits through an interactive chat. It uses a combination of multiple-choice questions and Natural Language Processing (NLP) on descriptive answers to generate a productivity profile and provide tailored recommendations.

## Features

-   **Interactive Chat Interface**: A user-friendly chatbot built with Streamlit that guides the user through the entire assessment.
-   **MCQ Analysis**: Scores users on 10 productivity-related questions and categorizes them into one of three profiles: "Focused Achiever," "Moderately Distracted," or "Burnout Risk." 
-   **NLP Analysis**: Analyzes open-ended user responses for:
-   **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines if the user's tone is positive, negative, or neutral. 
-   **Keyword Extraction**: Pulls out the most significant terms from the user's challenges.
-   **Behavioral Tagging**: Identifies patterns like procrastination, burnout, or time anxiety. 
-   **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides a list of "Basic (Free)" and "Premium (Advanced)" actions based on the user's final profile and behavioral tags.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` package manager

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.

**Create Virtual Environment and activate it**
conda create -p venv python==3.10 
conda activate venv/

Your terminal prompt should now begin with `(venv)`.

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required libraries from the `requirements.txt` file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Download NLTK Data
The NLP module requires specific data packages from the NLTK library. You only need to do this once. Run the following command to open a Python interpreter:

Run this command in the terminal

python -m nltk.downloader punkt punkt_tab

## How to Run

There are two ways to run this application.

### Option 1: Run the Interactive Chat App (Recommended)
This method launches the user-friendly web interface.

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the following command in your terminal:

    streamlit run app.py
Your default web browser will open with the chatbot, ready for interaction.

### Option 2: Run the Command-Line Version
This method runs the assessment in your terminal. Its main purpose is to generate the `output_data.json` file required for the submission.

1.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
2.  Run the following command in your terminal:
    
    python main.py
    

3.  Answer all the questions in the terminal. When you are finished, a file named **`output_data.json`** will be created in your project folder
